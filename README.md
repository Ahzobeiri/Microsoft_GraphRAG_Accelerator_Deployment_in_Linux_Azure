# Microsoft_GraphRAG_Accelerator_deployment_in_Linux_Azure
As you may know, the [Microsoft GraphRAG](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/) team published the [Github repo](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag) and Python code library for implementing GraphRAG in early July 2024. To get started with the GraphRAG system, Microsoft provided several options, including:

**1-** [Use the GraphRAG Accelerator solution](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator) by deploying it in Azure,  

**2-** [Install from pypi](https://pypi.org/project/graphrag/) by using ```pip install graphrag```,

**3-** [Use it from source](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/posts/developing/) by Python "[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx)" packaging.

Microsoft recommends trying the first approach i.e. the "Solution Accelerator package" in Microsoft Azure. In this repo, I will provide all the processes and necessary steps for deploying and developing the GrapRAG in Azure.
